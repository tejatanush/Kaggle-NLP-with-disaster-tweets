### Applications  
* Automatically detect and monitor disasters in real-time by analyzing tweets for mentions of natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes). This helps in providing early warnings and situational awareness.
* Assess the extent of damage caused by a disaster by analyzing the content of tweets. This application helps in understanding the impact on infrastructure, property, and human lives.
* Identify and prioritize resource needs in disaster-affected areas by analyzing tweets. This application helps in guiding rescue operations and humanitarian aid by understanding the urgent requirements of the affected 
  population.
